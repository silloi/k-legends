## 概要

Founded by Paloalto in 2010, Hi-Lite Records was previously recognized as one of the representative underground labels. However, the identity of the label changed when Paloalto appeared in SMTM season 4 as a producer in 2014 and Hi-Lite records partnered with CJ E&M in 2015. Hi-Lite Records signed with Yun B in 2016 and Won Woo Cho, a finalist in High School Rapper Season 1. In 2019, Swervy became the first female rapper to join Hi-Lite Records.
