## 概要

Founded by Dok2 and The Quiet in 2011, Illionaire signed with its first and the only artist Beenzino later that year.[23] The term Illionaire is a combination of word “Ill”, a slang term for 'cool', and 'millionaire.' The lyrical content of Illionaire artists are mostly associated with confidence, self-made wealth, and desire for success. These themes were uncommon in the mainstream Korean music industry prior to Illionaire Records. Their hit track YGGR, also known asYeongyeolgori went viral in the mainstream industry in 2014 after several appearances in Show Me the Money 3. Today, Illionaire records is widely accepted among the public as the most commercially successful hip hop label.
