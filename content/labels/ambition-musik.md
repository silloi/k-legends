## 概要

In September 2016, Dok2 and The Quiett started their second label, Ambition Musik, with the aim of introducing music that is different than what's usually presented under Illionaire records. The label is formed of relatively younger musicians including Changmo, who auditioned for SMTM 3 as well as Hash Swan and Kim Hyo Eun, who were part of SMTM 5. Changmo appeared as a producer in SMTM 7 in 2018 as well. In 2018, Ambition Musik signed with its fourth artist Ash Island, a finalist in Highschool Rapper season 2 formerly known as Jin Young Yoon. Zene the Zilla participated in Show Me The Money 8, and has collaborated with other notable rappers, such as Sik-K & Woodie Gochild of H1gher Music
