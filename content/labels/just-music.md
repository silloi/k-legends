## 概要

The label was founded in 2009 by rapper Swings, although the label saw frequent changes in their lineup early on. In 2014, the label saw resurgence after releasing their collaborative compilation album Ripple Effect , which was positively accepted and was awarded Album of the Year in the 2014 Hiphopplaya Awards.[63] Several members also participated in Show Me the Money Season 3, which led to their commercial success. In 2017 and 2019, the record label announced the foundation of Indigo Music and Wedaplugg Records, each dedicated to managing different groups of artists.
